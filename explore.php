                    Modelled on the original design of St Peter’s in Rome, this impressive church was built by Italian
                    friars of the Order of Theatines, sent here by Pope Urban VIII to preach Christianity in the kingdom
                    of Golconda (near Hyderabad). The friars, however, were refused entry to Golconda, so settled
                    instead
                    at Old Goa in 1640. The construction of the church began in 1655, and although it is perhaps less
                    interesting than the other churches, it is still a beautiful building and the only domed church
                    remaining in Goa. <br>
                    Though the altar is dedicated to Our Lady of Divine Providence, the church is named after the
                    founder of the Theatine order, St Cajetan (1480–1547), a contemporary of St Francis Xavier. Born in
                    Vicenza, St
                    Cajetan spent his whole life in Italy, establishing the Order of Theatines in Rome in 1524. He was
                    known for his work in hospitals and with ‘incurables', and for his high moral stance in an
                    increasingly
                    corrupt Roman Catholic church. He was canonised in 1671.

                    The Basilica of Bom Jesus is a Roman Catholic basilica located in Goa, India, and is part of the
                    Churches and convents of Goa UNESCO World Heritage Site.The basilica is located in Old Goa, former
                    capital of Portuguese India, and holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier. <br>
                    This is the only church in Old Goa not plastered on the outside, the lime plaster having been
                    stripped off by a zealous Portuguese conservationist in 1950. Apparently his notion was that exposed
                    to the elements, the laterite stone of which the basilica is built would become more durable and
                    thus the building would be strengthened.To the right of the altar is the slightly grisly highlight
                    for the vast
                    majority of visitors: the body of St Francis Xavier himself. The body was moved into the church in
                    1622, and installed in its
                    current mausoleum in 1698 courtesy of the last of the Medicis, Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in
                    exchange for the pillow on which St Francis’ head had been resting.

                    Fort Aguada is a well-preserved seventeenth-century Portuguese fort, along with a lighthouse,
                    standing in Goa, India, on Sinquerim Beach, overlooking the Arabian Sea. The fort was constructed in
                    1612 to guard against the Dutch and the Marathas. It was a reference
                    point for the vessels coming from Europe at that time. This old Portuguese fort stands on the beach
                    south of Candolim, at the shore of the Mandovi River. It was initially tasked with defense of
                    shipping and the nearby Bardez sub-district.A freshwater spring within the fort provided water
                    supply to the ships that used to stop by. This is
                    how the fort got its name: Aguada, meaning Water. Crews of passing ships would often visit to
                    replenish their freshwater stores. On the fort stands a four-story Portuguese lighthouse, erected in
                    1864 and the oldest of its kind in Asia. Built in 1612, it was once the grandstand of 79 cannons. It
                    has the capacity of storing 2,376,000 gallons of water, one of the biggest freshwater storages of
                    the time in whole of Asia. <br>
